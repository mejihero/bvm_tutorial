## BVM 2019 Tutorial: Hands-On Deep Learning using pytorch
(Max Blendowski, Christian Lucas & Mattias Heinrich)

# Overview / learning outcomes: 

The objective of this tutorial is to gain a good general overview of designing and training deep neural networks for medical image analysis using pytorch, at the end you should:
1) understand the principles of deep learning and its implementation with pytorch
2) build and train your own network and use autograd for unsupervised iterative registration
